📝 #Brief Application Description (Introduction) 
------------
The CookBook project is designed to serve as a social media platform inspired by the most successful social media ever, Facebook. It caters to users interested in cooking and offers seven features aimed at enhancing user quality of life and functionality.

The first feature is the login page, which serves as a check to determine whether the user has created an account or not. If they have, they are redirected to our 'discover' page. If not, they are directed to the registration page, where they can create a personal account with a securely hashed password for protection.

Upon logging in, users are directed to the discover page, which showcases recipes from the Spoonacular API and recipes created by the user. Here, users can also favorite recipes, which are then stored on their 'favorites' page for easy access.

Another notable feature is the 'addRecipe' page, allowing users to contribute their own recipes to the discover page. This encourages culinary enthusiasts to share their creative ideas with the community.

The 'View Recipe' page is where users can engage with recipes by commenting, liking, and viewing detailed instructions, fostering a sense of community and interaction.

Lastly, the project includes a logout button, which allows users to securely log out of their accounts on the website.

In summary, CookBook provides a platform for foodies and culinary enthusiasts to come together, share ideas, and interact with recipes, all while drawing inspiration from the success of Facebook's social media model. Users have personalized profiles showcasing their contributions and favorite recipes, creating a vibrant culinary community.
