# CookBook
Software Development CSCI 3308 Group Project

1. Application Description
The application will be designed to allow users to share their recipes with other users. They will be able to upload photos of their final dishes. Users will be able to like or dislike the recipes posted to the page, and the most liked recipes will be shown first. 
We also want to include a “cook friends” where the user can add other users as friends, and then the only posts on the “cook friends” page will be those of the users added as friends. We want to allow for the users to be able to sort by food type as well using a search bar.
